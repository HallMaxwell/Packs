## [`data_statistics_release.exe`](https://github.com/HallMaxwell/Packs/releases/tag/v1.5)
>#### Simple data statistics to form a frequency distribution table. 

I'm this code's author. It is designed for junior high school students learning data statistics.
>##### About the latest release:
- The code is updated to conform to the latest C standards.
- Automatically generate text records to prevent loss of data (empty at next launch).
- Optimized files for smaller size(release).
- This will cause memory usage and is **NOT** open source.
- It could be deleted by mistake by the computer system(See details at [**#1**](https://github.com/HallMaxwell/Packs/issues/1))
